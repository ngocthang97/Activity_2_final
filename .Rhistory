## 1B.Choose a single characteristic with a significant p-value when comparing between adherence and non-adherent groups, and describe in 2-3 sentences what this means in plain English.
## The adherent group's average daily CPAP usage was considerably higher (approximately 6.4 hours per night) than that of the non-adherent group (approximately 1.6 hours per night, p < 0.001).
## In plain English, adherent participants utilized their CPAP machines for significantly extended periods of time each night.  This affirms that the adherence status is indicative of the actual treatment behavior and emphasizes that device utilization is the primary determining factor between the two study groups.
## 1C.Choose a single characteristic with a non-significant p-value when comparing between adherence and non-adherent groups, and describe in 2-3 sentences what this means in plain English.
## There was no significant difference in age between adherent and non-adherent participants (p ≈ 0.90).
## This implies that the adherence to CPAP was not influenced by the age of the participants; younger and older individuals were equally likely to be adherent or non-adherent.  In layman's terms, the frequency with which an individual employs their CPAP device does not seem to be influenced by their age.
## 2 Test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in change from baseline to 6 months for ODSI for adherent versus non-adherent participants. Write out each step of the hypothesis test and clearly interpret your results in plain English in 2-3 sentences.
## Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no difference in the change of ODSI from baseline to 6 months between adherent and non-adherent participants.
## Alternative Hypothesis: # Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): There is a difference in the change of ODSI between adherent and non-adherent participants.
# Remove rows with missing values in 'odsi_6m'
clean_data <- Data %>%
filter(!is.na(ODSI_6m))
# Check the structure of the cleaned data

clean_data$odsi_change <- clean_data$ODSI_6m - clean_data$ODSI_baseline
# Impute missing values with the median of 'odsi_6m'

summary(Data$ODSI_6m)
# Calculate ODSI change again
clean_data <- clean_data %>%
mutate(odsi_change = ODSI_6m - ODSI_baseline)
# Test normality
shapiro.test(clean_data$odsi_change)
# Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis of
# normality. This indicates that the odsi_change data are not normally
# distributed.
# Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test (Mann-Whitney U test):
wilcox.test(odsi_change ~ adherence, data = clean_data,
alternative = "two.sided")
# The p-value from the Mann-Whitney U test is greater than 0.05, so we fail
# to reject the null hypothesis. This means there is no significant difference
# in the change of ODSI scores from baseline to 6 months between adherent and
# non-adherent participants.
#3. Hypothesis Test: Probability of Excessive Daytime Sleepiness at Baseline vs. 6 Months
## The objective is to ascertain if the likelihood of excessive daytime drowsiness, as determined by a cutoff score of 6 or above on the ODSI (Observation and Interview Based Diurnal drowsiness Inventory), is consistent from baseline to 6 months.
### State the Hypotheses Null Hypothesis (H₀): The likelihood of excessive daytime drowsiness remains constant from baseline to the 6-month mark.
### Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): The probability of excessive daytime sleepiness is different at baseline compared to at 6 months.
# Pick the Right TesTest: This is a comparison of the probabilities (proportions) of two groups: baseline and 6 months.  Because we are working with categorical data (whether or not someone is excessively sleepy), a McNemar's test or a Chi-squared test would work. However, we will utilize the McNemar's test for paired categorical data (baseline vs. 6 months for the same people).
# Get the Data Ready: We need to make a variable that shows if someone has excessive daytime sleepiness (ODSI > 6) at the start and again at 6 months.
# Make a variable with two values:
## 1 for too much sleepiness during the day (ODSI ≥ 6)
## 0 for not being too sleepy during the day (ODSI < 6)
# Create a binary variable for ODSI ≥ 6 at baseline and 6 months
Data$baseline_sleepy <- ifelse(Data$ODSI_baseline >= 6, 1, 0)
Data$month6_sleepy <- ifelse(Data$ODSI_6m >= 6, 1, 0)
# Create a contingency table for McNemar's test
table_sleepiness <- table(Data$baseline_sleepy, Data$month6_sleepy)
# Perform McNemar's test
mcnemar_test <- mcnemar.test(table_sleepiness)
mcnemar_test
# Conclusion
## Reject the null hypothesis because the p-value (0.0001357) is less than 0.05.
## There is a statistically significant difference in the likelihood of excessive daytime sleepiness (ODSI > 6) between the baseline and 6 months.
## To put it another way, the chances of experiencing too much daytime sleepiness at the start are not the same as the chances at 6 months. This indicates that the variation in tiredness across time is substantial in the sample.
#4A. Test the Null Hypothesis with Known Population Standard Deviation 1. State the Hypotheses
## Null Hypothesis (H₀): The average MMSE score for all study participants is over 23, which means they are not having any cognitive problems.
## Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): The mean MMSE score for all study participants is less than or equal to 23, signifying cognitive impairment.
#Sample data check
sample_mean <- mean(Data$MMSE, na.rm = TRUE)  # Calculate the sample mean
population_mean <- 23  # The threshold for cognitive impairment
population_sd <- 2.0  # Known population standard deviation
n <- length(Data$MMSE)  # Sample size
# Calculate the Z statistic
Z <- (sample_mean - population_mean) / (population_sd / sqrt(n))
# Calculate p-value for the one-tailed test (lower-tailed)
p_value <- pnorm(Z)  # For one-tailed lower test (check probability of Z being lower than the calculated value)
# Print results
Z
p_value
# How to Understand the Z Statistic: very high number, 30.32, is the Z statistic.  This means that the sample mean MMSE is far higher than the criteria for cognitive impairment, which is 23.
# p-value: The p-value of 1 means that it is very unlikely that the sample mean MMSE is less than 23.  The p-value being more than 0.05 means that there isn't enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.  To put it another way: This indicates that there is no substantial difference between the sample mean and the threshold value of 23, hence supporting the null hypothesis.
# Conclusion for People Who Don't Know Much About Statistics: We do not reject the null hypothesis because the p-value is quite high (1).  This indicates that the study participants possess a mean MMSE score exceeding 23, with no substantial evidence of cognitive impairment among the sample.
#4B. Test the Null Hypothesis with an Unknown Population Standard Deviation 1. Hypotheses
##Null Hypothesis (H₀): The average MMSE score of the study participants is 23 or higher, which means there is no cognitive impairment.
##Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): The average MMSE score of the people in the study is 23 or lower, which means they have cognitive problems.
#Sample data check:
sample_mean <- mean(Data$MMSE, na.rm = TRUE)  # Calculate the sample mean
population_mean <- 23  # The threshold for cognitive impairment
sample_sd <- sd(Data$MMSE, na.rm = TRUE)  # Sample standard deviation (not population standard deviation)
n <- length(Data$MMSE)  # Sample size
# Calculate the t-statistic
t_stat <- (sample_mean - population_mean) / (sample_sd / sqrt(n))
# Degrees of freedom for the t-distribution
df <- n - 1  # Degrees of freedom
# Calculate p-value for the one-tailed test
p_value_t <- pt(t_stat, df)  # For one-tailed lower test
# Print results
t_stat
p_value_t
# Understanding the t-statistic: The t-statistic of 34.08 is exceptionally high, which means that the sample mean MMSE is far higher than the criterion for cognitive impairment, which is 23.  This shows that the sample mean and the hypothesized population mean are very different from each other.
# Understanding the p-value: The p-value of 1 is exceptionally high.  This means that the sample mean MMSE is very unlikely to be less than 23. This means that there is no proof to reject the null hypothesis.
# We can't reject the null hypothesis because the p-value is higher than 0.05.
# Conclusion for an Audience Without Statistics: The p-value is 1, which suggests that the participants' average MMSE score is much higher than 23. This means that there is no proof that the individuals are cognitively impaired based on the MMSE score. In other words, we can't say for sure that the people in this study have cognitive problems solely on the MMSE results.
# 5. Compute and Report the Mean and Standard Deviation for the Variable Representing Average Daily CPAP Use

sd_cpap <- sd(Data$`Average daily CPAP (hr/night)`, na.rm = TRUE)
# Report the results
mean_cpap
sd_cpap
#Interpretation: The average daily CPAP use in this sample is approximately 5.15 hours per night. The standard deviation is 2.50 hours, which means there is a fairly wide variation in the amount of CPAP use across participants.
#5B Proportion of Participants with Average Daily CPAP Use Less Than 3 Hours
# Calculate the proportion of participants with average daily CPAP use < 3 hours
proportion_less_than_3 <- mean(Data$`Average daily CPAP (hr/night)` < 3, na.rm = TRUE)
# Report the proportion
proportion_less_than_3
# Interpretation: About 20.7% of the participants in the study use their CPAP machine for less than 3 hours per night. This suggests that a significant portion of the participants may not be adhering to the recommended CPAP usage, which could potentially affect the effectiveness of the therapy.
#To put it simply, about 20.7% of the people in this study use their CPAP machine for less than three hours a night.  This shows that a lot of people aren't using the CPAP machine for the right period of time, which could make it less effective at treating sleep apnea.

#6B. Estimate and Report the Proportion of Participants Who Are Considered Obese (BMI ≥ 30)
# Calculate the proportion of participants who are considered obese (BMI >= 30)
proportion_obese <- mean(Data$BMI >= 30, na.rm = TRUE)
# Report the proportion
proportion_obese
# Interpretation:
## The individuals in this study have an average BMI of 42.18, which is far higher than the acceptable range of 18.5 to 24.9.
## The standard deviation of 7.21 indicates significant variability in BMI among participants.
## The study found that about 96% of the people who took part had a BMI of 30 or more, which means they were obese.  This means that most of the people in this study are overweight or obese, which is something to keep in mind when looking at health consequences associated to obesity.

#For the adherent CPAP participants, the distribution of the Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) shows a mean value of approximately 34.5, with a standard deviation of about 21.2. The AHI ranges from a minimum of 15 to a maximum of 112.7. The histogram illustrates a skewed distribution, with a few higher values significantly influencing the overall spread of the data.
# In plain English, The Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) reveals a wide range of values for people who use CPAP.  The AHI is usually around 34.5, although it can be anywhere from 15 to 113.  This means that most people have mild AHI readings, but some have considerably higher values, which could mean that their symptoms are worse.  The AHI distribution is not even, which means that a small number of people with very high values affect the overall image.

#The mean of the sampling distribution of the sample means, which is based on 1,000 samples of size 30, is around 34.28, and the standard deviation is about 3.81.  As expected for sample distributions, the distribution is concentrated around the population mean (34.5) and has a narrower spread than the original AHI distribution.
#In plain English, If we randomly selected small groups of 30 participants from the data and measured their average AHI, we should anticipate the average to be about 34.3.  The spread, or variability, of these averages would be smaller than the original data, about 3.8.  This means that the sample averages are usually closer to the overall average (34.5), which makes the data easier to guess when looking at smaller groups.

# The average of the sample means is about 34.28 and the standard deviation is about 3.81. The sample size is 30.  The histogram above shows how the sample means are spread out, with a normal curve on top of it.  This curve fits the sampling distribution well, which means that the sampling distribution is close to a normal distribution.
# In simple terms, if we take 1,000 random samples of 30 people and find the average AHI for each group, the averages will look a lot like a normal distribution, which is a curve that looks like a bell.  The mean is still close to 34.3, and the range is narrower than the original AHI values.  This demonstrates that the average AHI values of numerous small groups of participants tend to be close to the genuine average (34.5), with a variance that we can expect.
# Finally, the empirical distribution from our random samples also displays this trait, with a mean that is similar and a spread that is less, compared to section (B), where we thought the sampling distribution would be normal.  This backs up the law of large numbers, which says that the sampling distribution gets closer to the genuine population mean.
